These servers are distinct from the IBM Cloud servers with separate networks and direct-attached storage. While the PowerVS internal networks are fenced, they still offer connectivity options to meet customer requirements, including public internet. This carefully calibrated infrastructure enables PowerVS to maintain key software certifications and support like their on-premises infrastructure, but with the added flexibility and capabilities that come from Cloud.</p> <p>The IBM Power Virtual Server workspace allows users to quickly create and deploy one or more virtual server instances (that are running either the AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems). After a PowerVS virtual server instance (VSI) is provisioned, users get access to the VSI without the need to manage or operate the physical servers. However, users must manage the operating system, software applications, and data. Given that this course is primarily a demonstration of infrastructure as a service, the guide does not delve deeply into the application layer or the day to day administrative tasks. The guide explores the fundamentals of working with PowerVS VSIs using the IBM Cloud Portal and command-line interfaces (CLIs).</p> <p>It is important to understand the difference in terminology between a PowerVS workspace and a PowerVS instance. Think of the PowerVS workspace as a container for all PowerVS instances at a specific geographic region. A workspace is also similar to a data center. PowerVS instances are virtual machines (VMs). For example, a Cloud account can have multiple PowerVS workspaces: one in Dallas, Texas, and another in Washington, D.C. Each service can contain multiple VSIs (also known as VMs). A workspace must be associated with an IBM Cloud resource group. Resource groups help in grouping resources and assigning permissions. To learn more, refer to Getting Started with IBM Power Virtual Server.</p> <p>The key parameters for a PowerVS workspace are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Data center location: As of June 2024, PowerVS is colocated with 21 IBM Cloud data centers that are located around the world. Consider choosing the data center that is located nearest to most users that access the PowerVS workloads.</p> </li> <li> <p>Workspace name: The PowerVS workspace name appears in the IBM Cloud Portal under the provisioned workspace. Specify a name that is easily understood and recognized.</p> </li> <li> <p>Resource group: Resource groups are used to organize resources in an IBM Cloud account. Administrative and access rights for all PowerVS resources are associated with the PowerVS workspace and not individual PowerVS instances (VMs). After a PowerVS workspace is assigned to a resource group, the resource group cannot be changed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Integrations: Optional integrations are also available from IBM Cloud. As of June 2024, the only integration available is with IBM Cloud Monitoring. IBM Cloud Monitoring allows users to gain visibility into the resources (VSIs) in the workspace.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Part%202/02%20Clickthru-service/","title":"Click through demonstration of a workspace being provisioned","text":"<p>Use the click through demonstration to practice provisioning an IBM Power Virtual Server (PowerVS) workspace.</p> <p>Note: Access to provision a new workspace is not provided in the IBM Technology Zone cloud account.
