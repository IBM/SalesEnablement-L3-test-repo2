There are a lot of other things you can do using MkDocs. 

Like, create tables. 

First Header | Second Header | Third Header
------------ | ------------- | ------------
Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell

They look ok, but the way you do it in markdown is kind of ugly: 

```
First Header | Second Header | Third Header
------------ | ------------- | ------------
Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell
```

To learn about tables go <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#tables" target="_blank">here</a> in the MkDocs documentation.

Note, sometimes it is confusing if you should go to the MkDocs documentation or the docs for the theme you are using (in our case the **material** theme). I don't have a good rule, so you should bookmark both!
