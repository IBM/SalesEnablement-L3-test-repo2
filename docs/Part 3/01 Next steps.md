!!! Important "There is always more to learn"
    
    By no means is what I included here about MkDocs and the material theme all there. Refer to the product doc links provided earlier!

We should always have a summary or next steps. I typically suggest reading the product documentation and other material available about the offering (like in Seismic). I also include a reminder about completing the learning plan in YL/learn.ibm.com.

**IBMers** sales must complete a Stand and Deliver exercise to validate their ability to demonstrate PowerVS to potential clients. Refer to the evaluation rubric in the learning plan to prepare your Stand and Deliver.

**Business Partners** must pass the PowerVS quiz from learn.ibm.com. Remember, take the quiz while the reservation to the TechZone environment is active. The Business Partner quiz verifies use of the demonstration environment and not general knowledge of the PowerVS offering.
