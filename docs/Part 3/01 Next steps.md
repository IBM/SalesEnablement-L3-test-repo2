!!! Important "There is always more to learn"
    
    By no means is what I included here about MkDocs and the material theme all there. Refer to the product doc links provided earlier!

We should always have a summary or next steps. I typically suggest reading the product documentation and other material available about the offering (like in Seismic). I also include a reminder about completing the learning plan in YL/learn.ibm.com.

**IBMers** sales must complete a Stand and Deliver exercise to validate their ability to demonstrate PowerVS to potential clients. Refer to the evaluation rubric in the learning plan to prepare your Stand and Deliver.

**Business Partners** must pass the PowerVS quiz from learn.ibm.com. Remember, take the quiz while the reservation to the TechZone environment is active. The Business Partner quiz verifies use of the demonstration environment and not general knowledge of the PowerVS offering.

!!! warning "Standard language in learn.ibm.com for BP Quiz"

    There is standard wording for the Level 3 Business Partner quiz that the migration team adds in learn.ibm.com. In short, it states all quiz questions can be answered using the "live" environment. For the PowerVS (and probably a few others), some of the quiz questions are pulled from the click through demonstrations that are part of the L3. If in future, you own/create one of these, be sure and ask the migration team to update the wording if you have questions that come from the click through demonstrations. Aa request to change I posted in slack can be found <a href="https://ibm-technology-sales.slack.com/archives/C01SXK2A7SQ/p1724071545296289" target="_blank">here</a>.
